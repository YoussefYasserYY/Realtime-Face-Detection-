# Face Detection App

This is a simple **Face Detection App** that uses OpenCV to detect faces in real-time using a webcam. The application is designed to work with **Streamlit** for an interactive user interface.

## 📌 Features
- Uses OpenCV's **Haar Cascade Classifier** to detect faces.
- Real-time face detection from a webcam feed.
- Displays the detected faces with bounding boxes.
- Allows stopping the video stream with a **checkbox** in Streamlit.

```bash
pip install opencv-python streamlit
```
